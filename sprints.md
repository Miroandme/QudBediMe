#Sprints

At Sungevity, our sprints are two-weeks in duration.

##Sprint Backlog
Each Sprint has a "backlog" of User Stories that the Scrum Team has committed to complete during the Sprint. The sum of the Story Points for the User Stories in the Sprint Backlog indicates the planned sprint velocity of the team. The number of Story Points for completed User Stories in each sprint yields the actual sprint velocity.

##Velocity
Velocity is the measure of the Story Points that the Scrum Team is completing every sprint. Generally this will be a rolling average of the actual velocity achieved for a number of preceeding sprints. The Scrum Master may remove obvious outliers from this set to help determine a more accurate velocity measure.

##Activities
Sprints are shaped and evaluated through [these activites](sprints-activities.md).
