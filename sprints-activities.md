#Activities During a Sprint
During a Sprint at Sungevity the Scrum Master will invite you to participate in some or all of the following activites as part of a Scrum Team.

##Sprint Planning
The Scrum Team selects the highest priority items from the Product Backlog that can be worked on, based on their team Velocity. The User Stories (and bugs, and whetever else is selected) are moved to the Sprint backlog for the Sprint being planned. Ideally a Scrum Team has three or more sprints planned. Work moved into a Sprint in this way represents a commitment by the whole Scrum Team to complete all the work represented by the User Stories within that Sprint. Sprint planning is typically performed as the last activity of the proceeding sprint, the first activity of the current sprint, or in advance.

##Story Writing
User Stories may be defined by the Product Owner alone or in collaboration with some or all of the Scrum Team as appropriate to achieve high-quality stories. 

##Story Sizing
The Scrum Team meets to collaboratively determine the Story Points to assign to each User Story. Ideally the Product Backlog is always in a sized state so the Scrum Team will meet as often as required to achieve this goal. 

##Demo
At the end of the Sprint, usually the last Friday, members of the Scrum Team demonstrate releasable software to the whole Scrum Team to prove that User Stories are completed. Typically the Product Owner makes the final determination as to whether the demonstrated software achieves the goals of the User Stories. 

The demonstrated software must be releasable; therefore the demonstrated software will be deployed to a TechOps managed environment such as a development or QA server. 

##Retrospective
At the end of every Sprint, it is vital that the Scrum Team can learn from experience by recognizing what went well and what needs to be improved.
