### Why use Story Points instead of time?
Story Points measure more than just effort; they also encompass risk, complexity and uncertainty. Velocity and Story Points work together to provide a self-correcting measure. If the team sizes 20-points of User Stories and completes 18-points, then the velocity of that team is 18-points and the next sprint can be planned based on this velocity. If the same team sized the same work as 40-points and completed 36-points then the team velocity would be 36-points. The absolute values are abstract. 

### Why are bugs not sized?
Bugs represent work that was not completed as part of the original User Story. At Sungevity we are choosing not to size bugs so that bug fixing will have a negative impact on measured velocity. Recall that Story Points are not intended to be a measure of effort. When a User Story is marked as completed in a prior sprint such that it's Story Points are added to that Sprint's velocity; when a bug is found in a following sprint, the desired indicator is that time spent remedying the defect represents an opportunity cost against working on the stories for that sprint.

### At my previous company we did Scrum differently. Which was right? Which way is best?
Scrum is a series of principles and practices, which are typically mapped to how an organization thinks it should operate. In reality, almost every organization does Scrum (or any other Agile method) a little differently. Whilst there is no one-size-fits-all policy, the important question is whether the process is working effectively for the organization.

### I don't like something. Can we change it?
Yes. And no. The Scrum Teams and Software management are constantly evaluating what is working and what is not. We will apply the lessons and improvements identified during Sprint Retrospectives make changes that improve our effectiveness. It is however, impossible to please everyone all the time.

### What if I can't make it to to the Daily Stand-up (Scrum)?
Life happens. As a courtesy to the other Scrum Team members, if you cannot make it to the Daily Stand-up for the project you are assigned to, please email your anwswers to the three questions to the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master should ensure that you are represented during the stand-up. Your manager will definitely appreciate being copied on this email.

### My User Story is mostly complete so can I claim partial Story Point credit?
Absolutely not. There's a tendency for software to languish in the "nearly-but-not-quite-done" 20% space of the [Pareto Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) so awarding partial points could easily give a false sense of progres. It's done when it's done, tested, demonstrated and approved by the Product Owner.

### What's the difference between a Product Manager and a Product Owner?
The Product Owner is a role within a Scrum Team. This role can be performed by many different individuals, including a Sungevity Product Manager, a Sungevity Project Manager, a Business Stakeholder, or a Lead User from the User Community.
