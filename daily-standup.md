#Daily Stand-up (Scrum)

Generally the Scrum Team assembles at a known time every day during the Sprint and each member answers these three questions:

1. What did I achieve yesterday?
2. What do I plan to achieve today?
3. What is blocking or impeding my progress?

Please focus on achievement, rather than effort; i.e. it's more interesting and useful for the team to know that you attempted to complete an API interface yesterday but discovered additional work and you are planning on completing the API interface today. Please speak clearly, with sufficient volume so everyone present can hear. Please address yourself to the whole team, not just the Scrum Master.

This time is not a status-meeting and should primarily disseminate information that helps the Scrum Team. This is not the time to unpack issues or technical problems. When the team identifies matters requiring further discussion, the team will call for a "break-out" meeting. If the team is bogged-down in discussion, the Scrum Master will typically intervene and call for a "break-out".
